# Build Failures

## Setting up responsible party for build failures.

The person would respond to EVERY failure in Jenkins leading up an investigation. This person would be responsible for driving the triage and fix for the failure.

1. Respond to Jenkins Build Failure or Error E-Mail
2. Triage issue to a larger category (build system, code breakage, environment issue, timeouts, etc...)
3. Follow-up with related teams with findings sending out a status email on progress
4. Drive the resolution through an issue or email visible to concerned teams.
5. Verify the failure is resolved.


## Sending out status daily and weekly

This is a script of plug-in to be made that would send all failure related status from the build server daily and/or weekly. This would also need some party to take the lead on pushing for answers on why the failures have occurred and drive the resolution to completion.


1. Get a report from Jenkins with a summary of failures.
2. Do same steps from option 1 in bulk.
