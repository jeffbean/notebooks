Started an organic note sheet to possibly help  anyone interested in the container area, have a lower point of entry on finding some relevant materials.
[Found here](../../containers/).

## Tech news I find interesting
* New Open [Cloud Native Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2015/07/new-cloud-native-computing-foundation-drive-alignment-among)
* [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) 1.0 Launch
* Greg Knieriemen from HDS talks about Kubernetes on The Register [podcast](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/07/22/speaking_in_tech_episode_169/).


## R&D to look into
After learning that JSON is heavy when thinking at scale, found out about Protocol Buffers.
* [Prorocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)
    * [Google Github](https://github.com/google/protobuf) for protobuf implementation.

Need to learn and use GO for all new scripts/tools from here on out.
* [Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org/)
* [Go Cheat sheet](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/go/)


## Meetups in Seattle
* Looking at [OpenStack Seattle Meetup: OpenStack Networking ("Neutron"Â­): Advanced Series](http://www.meetup.com/OpenStack-Seattle/events/224094478/)
