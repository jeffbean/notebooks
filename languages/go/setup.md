Check that Go is installed correctly by building a simple program, as follows.

Create a file named hello.go and put the following program in it:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Printf("hello, world\n")
}
```
Then run it with the go tool:

```
$ go run hello.go
hello, world
```
If you see the "hello, world" message then your Go installation is working.
