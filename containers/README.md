## Breaking it down

### Container Host Operating systems

Before we can run Docker or any other container we need to first have a OS that runs containers. Most Linux distributions support Docker but are also bloated with extra packages that are not necessary. A new set of Operating systems have now been created specifically for container workloads.


The premise of the container OS is to have the lightest host OS footprint so you can run purely containers on the host. Many of them come pre-installed and configured out of the box so you don't have to worry about bootstrapping an OS with many of the tools you need to run a containerized workload.

## container engine (runtime)

The tool that actually runs the containers is referred to as the container engine. Today there are many flavors of an engine but the most popularized is Docker.

Docker donated to the Open Container Project the container engine from Docker and is now called [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) that could become the standard across all the different tools. This would mean that all container engines could then run any other engines images. A single format for all.

 The following are the current container engines.

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [rkt](https://github.com/coreos/rkt)
* [appc](https://github.com/appc/spec)
* [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)

## images
Images are what containers are made from. You build ship and run the images for the container engine. The container engine then runs and manages that now running container.

## storage

## orchestration
Once you start using containers for more than just dev/test it will become necessary to have orchestration.

## Dockercon15
* Good overall talk. MUST WATCH [Adrien Cockcraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDuTIZBh5_Q&list=PLkA60AVN3hh94tm0_6_rGxamkuHOLr30l&index=12)
* Great talk on definitions [Resilient Routing and Discovery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDeAEZHby_A&list=PLkA60AVN3hh94tm0_6_rGxamkuHOLr30l&index=15)
* The [Keynote Day 1](http://www.slideshare.net/Docker/dockercon-sf-2015-keynote-day-1) has a video embedded. Perfect way to learn about how Docker sees the Docker movement.
* The [Keynote Day 2](http://www.slideshare.net/Docker/dockercon-15-keynote-day-2) includes the panel discussion.
* Good for tech people that are looking to user the Docker registry. [Registry 2](http://www.slideshare.net/Docker/docker-registry-v2)
